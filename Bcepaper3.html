<h4>4.Explain about </h4><br>
<h4>(a) autoexe.bat</h4>
<p>AUTOEXEC.BAT is a system file that was originally on DOS-type operating systems. It is a plain-text batch file in the root directory of the boot device. The name of the file is an abbreviation of "automatic execution", which describes its function in automatically executing commands on system startup; the filename was coined in response to the 8.3 filename limitations of the FAT file system family.</p>
<h4>b)config.sys</h4>
<p>CONFIG.SYS is a text file containing disk operating system (DOS) commands that tell the operating system (OS) how the computer is initially set up. More specifically, CONFIG.SYS commands specify memory device drivers and programs that control hardware devices, enable or disable system features and set limits on system resources.</p>
<h4>5. List and explain five internal DOS commands?</h4>
<h4><u>Pages in category "Internal DOS commands":</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>CALL (DOS command)</li>
<li>Cd (command)</li>
<li>CHCP (DOS command)</li>
<li>CLEAR (DOS command)</li>
<li>CLS (command)</li>
<li>CLS (DOS command)</li>
<li>COMMAND (command)</li>
<li>Copy (command)</li>
</ul>  
<h4>6. Write the steps to install a printer using the control panel<br></h4>
<ul>
<li>Select the Start  button, then select Settings  > Devices > Printers & scanners > Add a printer or scanner.</li>
<li>Wait for it to find nearby printers, then choose the one you want to use, and select Add device. If you want to remove the printer later, just highlight it and select Remove.</li><br>

</ul><hr><hr> 
<h4>7. Describe address format and IP address in detail</h4>
 <p>
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet. Typically assigned by an internet service provider (ISP), an IP address is an online device address used for communicating across the internet.
</p><p>The IP address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a network interface on a machine. An IP address is typically written in decimal digits, formatted as four 8-bit fields separated by periods. Each 8-bit field represents a byte of the IP address.</p><hr><hr>
<h4>8. <u>a)What is a web browser software and explain its functions?</u></h4>
<b><u>Web browser</u></b>
<p> A software application used to access information on the World Wide Web is called a Web Browser. When a user requests some information, the web browser fetches the data from a web server and then displays the webpage on the user's screen.</p>
<p>
A web browser takes you anywhere on the internet. It retrieves information from other parts of the web and displays it on your desktop or mobile device. The information is transferred using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which defines how text, images and video are transmitted on the web.</p>
<h4><b>Types of web browser</b></h4>
<h4>
1)world wide web<br>
2)mosaic<br>
3)netscape navigator<br>
4)internet explorer<br>
5)Firefox
6)gogle chrome
</h4>
<h4><u>b)Describe DHCP</u><br></h4>
<p>DHCP is a client-server protocol in which servers manage a pool of unique IP addresses, as well as information about client configuration parameters. The servers then assign addresses out of those address pools. DHCP-enabled clients send a request to the DHCP server whenever they connect to a network.</p><hr><hr>
<h4>9. Write the importance of cache memory<br></h4>
<p>Cache memory is a chip-based computer component that makes retrieving data from the computer's memory more efficient. It acts as a temporary storage area that the computer's processor can retrieve data from easily.
</p>
<p>
The cache memory basically acts as a buffer between the main memory and the CPU. Moreover, it synchronizes with the speed of the CPU. Besides, it stores the data and instructions which the CPU uses more frequently so that it does not have to access the main memory again and again.</p>
<p>
Cache is the temporary memory officially termed “CPU cache memory.” This chip-based feature of your computer lets you access some information more quickly than if you access it from your computer's main hard drive.</p>
<p>
The cache is defined as a hardware or software component embedded in an application or device memory that automatically and temporarily stores data consumed by the user to reduce the data retrieval time the next time the application or device is accessed. This article explains this concept in detail and lists its types and key benefits.</p><br>

<h4>10. What is disk defragmentation?<br></h4>
<p>
Defragmentation organizes the individual files, resulting in improved hard drive speed. Unused space is freed. Any unused space on a hard drive can be maximized by defragmentation. Sometimes, it can also create more usable space if bits of data are left over from deleted files.</p>
<p>Defragmentation can solve and mitigate problems, such as slow speeds, freeze-ups and extended boot times of a computer. If there's not enough contiguous space to hold complete files on an HDD, files can become fragmented and the storage algorithms on the disk separate the data to fit it inside the available space. Defragmentation consolidates these fragmented files so all the related pieces are aligned together.</p>
<p>
A fragmented hard drive is similar to a huge, jumbled-up load of laundry, where all the different clothing types and colors are mixed up. Once the HDD is defragmented, the system performance improves because all the jumbled-up data is reorganized and stored appropriately.
</p>
<p>The following are the main benefits of defragmenting a hard drive:</p>

<p><u>*Files stay organized.</u> Over time, adding and deleting files from a hard drive can make the data scattered, especially if it's running low on storage space. Defragmentation organizes the individual files, resulting in improved hard drive speed.</p>
<p><u>*Unused space is freed</u>. Any unused space on a hard drive can be <p><u>*maximized by defragmentation.</u> Sometimes, it can also create more usable space if bits of data are left over from deleted files.</p>
The HDD life is extended. With regular defragmentation, the files on a hard drive stay organized. This means the mechanical and spinning components of a hard drive aren't used as extensively, which in turn extends the life span of a hard drive.</p>
<h4>11.  List any three input devices and out put devices</h4>
<u><b>Input devices:</u></b>
</h5><p>input devices are used for giving input to the system by the user some the inputs are:</p></h5>
<ul>
<li>keyboard</li>
<li>mouse</li>
<li>Scanner</li>
<li>joystick</li>
<li>web camera</li>
</ul>
<u><b>output devices:</u></b>
<p>Any information processed by and sent out from a computer or other electronic device is considered output. </p>
<ul>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>speakers</li>
<li>console</li>
<li>projector</li>
<li>laser printer</li>
</ul><hr><hr>
<h4>12. Write an algorithm to find whether the given number is prime or not<br></h4>
<h4>To check whether a given number N is prime or not, We have to check if number is divisible by any number from 2 to N-1. If it is not divided by any number then it is a prime number else it is not a prime number.</h4>

<br><hr><hr>
<h4>14. List any six components of windows</h4>
<h5>The main components of Windows when you start your computer are :</h5>

<ul>
<li>Dektop</li>
<li>Recycle bin</li>

<li>Start button</li>
<li>Window search</li>
<li>File exploser</li>
<li>Settings</li>
<li>menu bar</li>
</ul><hr><hr>
<h4>15. Define the term GSM</h4>
<p>
The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets.</p>
